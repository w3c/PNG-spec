# Portable Network Graphics (PNG) specification

This repository is for the maintenance of the [PNG specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/),
which is jointly published by W3C as a W3C Recommendation,
and by ISO as an International Standard ISO/IEC 15948:2003 (E)
with identical contents.

This repository is being used to fold in [errata](https://www.w3.org/2003/11/REC-PNG-20031110-errata)
into an [Editors Draft](https://w3c.github.io/PNG-spec/),
and also for discussion and update of any technical changes or additions.

The [PNG Extensions specification](https://w3c.github.io/PNG-spec/extensions/Overview.html) is also here.
